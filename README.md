# Mystical

This repository contains a PostScript-based system for drawing magical circles and a small web prototype for experimenting with rune circles.

## Running the Rune Circle Demo

1. Install Python 3 (if not already installed).
2. From the repository root, run:
   ```bash
   python3 run_server.py
   ```
   This starts a local web server and opens the demo in your browser.
3. Use the interface to add runes or nested circles. The interpretation of the spell is shown below the buttons.

The PostScript files for the original Mystical project are located under `mystical_ps/`. See `mystical_ps/README.md` for full documentation.
